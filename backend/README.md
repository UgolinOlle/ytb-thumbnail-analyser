# Technical Documentation - YouTube Thumbnail Analyzer (Backend)

## Architecture Overview

The YouTube Thumbnail Analyzer backend is built using FastAPI, a modern, high-performance Python web framework for building APIs. The application follows a modular architecture, emphasizing separation of concerns and scalability.

## Key Technologies

- FastAPI
- Python 3.11+
- SQLAlchemy (for ORM)
- Pydantic (for data validation)
- MySQL (via mysql-connector-python)
- Groq API (for image analysis)
- Pillow (for image processing)

## Project Structure

The backend project structure is organized as follows:

```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── v1/
│   │       └── thumbnail/
│   │           └── endpoints.py
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── clients/
│   │   ├── configs/
│   │   ├── handlers/
│   │   └── schemas/
│   ├── db/
│   │   ├── crud/
│   │   └── models/
│   └── services/
├── main.py
└── requirements.txt
```

## Core Components

### 1. FastAPI Application (main.py)

The main FastAPI application is initialized in `main.py`. It sets up CORS middleware, connects to the database, and includes the API routes.

### 2. API Endpoints (endpoints.py)

The primary API endpoint for thumbnail upload and analysis is defined in `endpoints.py`. It handles file uploads, validates images, and processes them using the Groq API.

### 3. Database Models (thumbnail.py)

The SQLAlchemy model for the Thumbnail table is defined in `thumbnail.py`. It represents the structure of the database table used to store thumbnail analysis results.

### 4. Database Configuration (database.py)

The `Database` class in `database.py` manages database connections, sessions, and provides methods for interacting with the database.

### 5. Image Analysis Service (image_analyser.py)

The `analyze_thumbnail` function in `image_analyser.py` handles the integration with the Groq API for image analysis and score calculation.

### 6. Groq Client (groq.py)

The `GroqClient` class in `groq.py` manages the interaction with the Groq API, including image encoding and sending requests for analysis.

## Data Flow

1. The client uploads an image via the `/api/v1/thumbnail/` endpoint.
2. The backend validates the image file type and integrity.
3. The image is sent to the Groq API for analysis using the `GroqClient`.
4. The analysis result is processed, and a score is calculated.
5. The result is stored in the database using SQLAlchemy ORM.
6. The analysis result is returned to the client.

## Error Handling

Custom error handlers are implemented to manage various types of errors, including invalid file types, database errors, and Groq API errors. These are defined in `error.py` and `error_database.py`.

## Configuration Management

Application settings are managed using Pydantic's `BaseSettings` in `globals.py`, which loads configuration from environment variables.

## Database Operations

CRUD operations for thumbnails are handled in `thumbnail.py` within the `crud` directory.

## API Models

Pydantic models for request and response validation are defined in `thumbnail.py` within the `schemas` directory.

## Security Considerations

- CORS middleware is configured to control access to the API.
- Environment variables are used for sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.
- Input validation is performed using Pydantic models and custom checks.

## Performance and Scalability

- Asynchronous operations are used where possible to improve concurrency.
- Database connection pooling is implemented through SQLAlchemy.
- The application is designed to be stateless, allowing for horizontal scaling.
